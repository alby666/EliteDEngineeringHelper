Autohotkey Helper script to automate the application of engineering in Elite Dangerous

Requires AutoHotkey v1.1.31.00 or later https://www.autohotkey.com/download/

This script automates the actions to apply engineering to Elite Dangerous components theough key automation based on what your commander has unlocked.

Run the script and press F1 for the completion of one level of engineering through to F5 for 5.
F9 to reload the script if you make changes.
Shift+F9 to kill the script if anything goes wrong!

To start the script you MUST be in the engineering screen with the engineering recipe selected on the left that you wish to apply. Press F1 to F5 to apply the number of levels you require.

*Currently the script is a bit limited so it takes a a few seconds for the lower levels to timeout after completion so leave it running until you hear the beeps!!!*
